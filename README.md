# book-review-page
The first version is only basic HTML only.
This Web page allows you to add book-reviews and delete the existing reviews. There is no CSS used however it has a Public folder where it contains the style.css folder. 

Wanted to keep the first version raw and simple. I have used PostgreSQL databse which stores the data entered by the user. The backend is built with the Node.js and Express.js . 
Eventually this repo will be containing the new versions in upcoming time.
I will be upgrading it. Adding proper style to the site, add the authentication and other some features.
